# API Gateway

## Introduction

This project is an API Gateway developed in Go, designed to manage communication between microservices. The API Gateway includes features such as load balancing, rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring. It serves as a central entry point for clients to access various microservices within the system.

## Features

- **Routing**: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on defined routes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of microservices to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame to prevent abuse and maintain system stability.
- **Authentication**: Authenticates clients before allowing access to protected endpoints, ensuring data security and integrity.
- **Monitoring**: Provides monitoring and logging capabilities to track request traffic, errors, and performance metrics for better system management and troubleshooting.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: `cd api_gateway`
3. **Build the Application**: `go build`
4. **Run the Application**: `./api_gateway`

## Usage

1. **Define Routes**: Add route definitions in the `routes` directory.
2. **Implement Controllers**: Implement controller logic for handling requests in the `controllers` directory.
3. **Configure Middleware**: Configure middleware functions for authentication, rate limiting, and logging in the `middleware` directory.
4. **Integrate Services**: Integrate with microservices by implementing service logic in the `services` directory.
5. **Start the Server**: Run the API Gateway using `./api_gateway` and access endpoints as defined in the routes.
